\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Class Overview}
The simulator comprises six key modules, each handling a specific aspect of the L1 cache simulation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{TraceReader}: Reads and parses memory access traces for each core.
    \item \textbf{Core}: Simulates a processor coreâ€™s execution, issuing memory instructions and managing stalls.
    \item \textbf{Cache}: Models a private, E-way set-associative L1 data cache per core with $2^s$ sets and $2^b$-byte blocks. Supports write-back, write-allocate, LRU replacement, and MESI coherence.
    \item \textbf{Bus}: A shared communication medium handling coherence transactions and arbitration.
    \item \textbf{Simulator}: Orchestrates core execution, bus activity, and simulation cycles.
    \item \textbf{StatsPrinter}: Aggregates and reports cache performance metrics.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Module Descriptions}

\subsubsection{TraceReader}
Reads trace files (one per core) line-by-line. Each line specifies a memory operation (R or W) and a hexadecimal address, converted into \texttt{TraceEntry} structs with a 32-bit address and operation type. Uses standard C++ I/O with input validation.

\subsubsection{Core}
Represents a CPU core, executing one memory operation per cycle unless stalled. Communicates with its private L1 cache and other caches via the bus. Features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Instruction stream from the trace.
    \item Counters for instructions, read/write operations, idle cycles, and total cycles.
    \item State tracking for stalls due to cache misses or coherence waits.
    \item \texttt{tick()} function to issue instructions or increment idle time.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Cache}
Each core has a local cache configured with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $E$ lines per set, $2^s$ sets, and block size of $2^b$ bytes.
    \item Cache lines storing tags, MESI states, LRU timestamps, valid/dirty flags.
    \item Read/write methods updating LRU order on hits and initiating coherence on misses.
    \item \texttt{allocateBlock()} and \texttt{handleMiss()} for block allocation and evictions.
    \item Snooping support for BusRd, BusRdX, and MESI transitions (e.g., Shared $\to$ Invalid).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Bus}
Manages inter-cache coherence communication:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Round-robin arbitration for transactions.
    \item Queues for pending transactions, prioritizing BusRdX over BusRd or WriteBack.
    \item \texttt{tick()} processes transactions, handles snoop responses, and triggers cache state changes.
    \item Tracks bytes transferred and latency for memory vs. cache-to-cache transfers.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Simulator}
Coordinates cores and caches. In each cycle:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Calls \texttt{tick()} on each core.
    \item Updates the bus and processes snoop responses.
    \item Monitors termination when all cores finish their traces.
    \item Finalizes per-core cycle counts and statistics.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{StatsPrinter}
Reports:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cache parameters (size, associativity, block size).
    \item Per-core stats: accesses, execution/idle cycles, misses, evictions, writebacks, invalidations.
    \item Bus stats: total transactions and data transferred.
\end{itemize}

\section{Design Decisions}
The L1 cache simulator incorporates key design choices for realistic behavior, deterministic execution, and manageable complexity:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Idle Cycle Definition}: Idle cycles occur when a core waits for memory operations, including bus coherence or memory fetches. Total cycles = execution cycles + idle cycles.
    \item \textbf{MESI Protocol}: Implements full MESI with transitions:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Shared $\to$ Modified: Issues BusRdX, triggers invalidations.
            \item Modified $\to$ Shared/Invalid: Via snooping on BusRd/BusRdX.
            \item Modified writebacks: 100-cycle latency.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Writebacks}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Eviction: Synchronous writeback of dirty blocks.
            \item Snoop-triggered: Writeback before Modified $\to$ Shared/Invalid.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Bus Arbitration}: One transaction at a time, prioritized:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item BusUpgr (1 cycle).
            \item BusRdX, WriteBack.
            \item BusRd (lowest priority).
        \end{enumerate}
        Tie-breaking by ascending core ID.
    \item \textbf{Deterministic Core Order}: Cores 0â€“3 tick in fixed order for reproducibility.
    \item \textbf{Blocking Cache}: Core stalls on misses until transaction completes; caches respond to snoops in parallel.
    \item \textbf{Memory Latencies}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item L1 hit: 1 cycle.
            \item Memory fetch: 100 cycles.
            \item Cache-to-cache: 2 cycles per 4-byte word.
            \item Writeback: 100 cycles.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cache Initialization}: All lines invalid at start (cold cache).
    \item \textbf{Word/Block Size}: 4-byte words, $2^b$-byte blocks.
    \item \textbf{Simplified Data}: Only tags, states, and timing modeled.
    \item \textbf{No Bus Pipelining}: One transaction at a time.
    \item \textbf{Microbenchmark Verification}: Validated MESI and writebacks with 2â€“5 instruction traces.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Performance Analysis}

To evaluate cache parameter impacts, we conducted experiments varying one parameter at a time while keeping others fixed at:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Number of sets: $2^s = 64$
    \item Associativity: $E = 2$
    \item Block size: $B = 32$ bytes
\end{itemize}

For each parameter, we doubled its value across runs and measured the \textbf{maximum execution cycles across all cores}, reflecting total workload completion time, including computation and stalls due to memory or coherence delays. Experiments used provided application traces, with results recorded for comparison.

\section{Implementation Challenges}

Key challenges encountered include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Precise Cycle Synchronization}: Managing a global simulation loop while allowing independent core instruction issuance required careful delay handling for memory fetches, writebacks, and coherence events.
    \item \textbf{MESI State Coordination}: Ensuring correct MESI transitions across cores demanded rigorous tracking of local and remote operations, especially for Modified $\to$ Shared or Exclusive $\to$ Invalid transitions.
    \item \textbf{Bus Arbitration and Fairness}: Modeling realistic contention with deterministic behavior involved priority-based selection and round-robin tie-breaking.
    \item \textbf{Blocking Behavior and Stall Management}: Simulating blocking cachesâ€”halting cores on misses while responding to coherence requestsâ€”required separating execution from snoop handling and tracking core resumption.
    \item \textbf{Edge Case Handling}: Malformed trace files, invalid inputs, and misaligned addresses necessitated robust validation.
    \item \textbf{Comprehensive Metric Tracking}: Accurate tracking of idle cycles, evictions, writebacks, and data traffic required consistent counters across modules without double-counting.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}

Our L1 cache simulator accurately models a quad-core processor with MESI coherence, write-back/write-allocate policy, and LRU eviction. It captures private cache and shared memory interactions, providing cycle-accurate statistics.

Key trends from parameter variation experiments:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Cache Size}: Larger caches reduce capacity and compulsory misses, but benefits plateau when the working set is fully accommodated.
    \item \textbf{Associativity}: Higher associativity (2-way or 4-way) reduces conflict misses, improving hit rates but potentially increasing access latency.
    \item \textbf{Block Size}: Balancing transfer time and spatial locality, block sizes of 32â€“64 bytes performed best for our traces.
\end{enumerate}

These results highlight cache architecture trade-offs and the importance of workload-specific configurations. The simulator enables functional validation and performance exploration in multicore systems.
